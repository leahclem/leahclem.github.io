<h2>Home Page</h2>
<p>Home to the Virginia Tech Hokies and popular rest point for many hikers of the Apalachian Trail. When the school semester is in session the town is brimming with a multitude of students who make up the majority of the population. Weekend nights downtown are always lively and sometimes rowdy. Every resturant fills up with students, making eating out quite the task. But if you enjoy noisy and fun atmospheres,and don't mind waiting for food and seating, then Downtown Blacksburg is definitely the place to be. Because it is a college town, Blacksburg has no lack of coffee shops for studying and hanging out. There are at least four Starbucks and several nice, locally owned, coffee shops. During the summer, when the students return home, Blacksburg slows down a bit while still maintaining quite a few weekend outing options.  </p>
