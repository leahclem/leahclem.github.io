<br>This restaurant is located on North Main Street heading downtown; you’ll see it directly on the left after the traffic circle. 
</em>
	<br>One of  the classier restaurants in Blacksburg, 622 serves some of the best brunch and  dinner in the area. This restaurant shares the same owner as the equally delicious Lefty's restaurant.

</em>
	<br>This little French bakery isn't in a very picturesque area, but it makes up for the  lack of scenery with its fantastic food and cute interior. I love brunch, and  theirs is delicious. You must stand in line to order, which can take a while,  but once you take a number and a table, the food arrives quickly.

	Hello Bagel is a cute little bagel and coffee shop on South Main. There's a huge variety of breakfast and lunch bagels to choose from. They also have a huge selection of ingredients for those who enjoy crafting their own bagel sandwich.

<br>Easy to spot on Main Street in downtown Blacksburg, across the street from Starbucks and the Kent Square Parking Garage.  
</em>
	<br>When you get tired of hamburgers and sandwiches everywhere, Cabo is the perfect place for something a bit different. Their fish tacos and fajitas are amazing, and they offer vegan options as well. The restaurant was even featured by Guy Fieri on Food Network.

<br>The Taphouse is across the road from Waffle House and Taco Bell and on the right side after the roundabout on North Main Street.   
</em>
	<br>If you’re in the mood for a burger and some craft beer, then Blacksburg Taphouse is the place to go. With a steady menu of packed burgers, plus the weekly specials, there’s quite a few options to choose from. I also work there as a server, so here’s a tip: if you like the sound of a specific burger topping, you can add it to any other burger on the menu.
