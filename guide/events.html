<h3>Vintage Market</h3>
<br><em>Sunday of every month from April - November 10am-5pm 
</em>
	<br>
	Held in Market Square, Vintage Market is an offshoot of the Farmer's Market with a selection of vendors offering an eclectic collection of goods. Upcycled crafts, antiques, and quality vintage items including clothing and accessories. I really love it when I can find some cool vintage folk art to hang on my wall, it's nice to find stuff that you wouldn't usually see elsewhere.

<br><em>Royal Wedding May 19th, 2018
</em>
	<br>
	The Lyric, known as "the Heart of Blacksburg", is an amazing place to visit while in the area. Its old style and replica lanterns transport the viewer into the past during whatever show they come to see. I watched an amazing performance of <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em> and I'll never forget the old timey feel and fantastic ambiance the theater added to the show. This year the Lyric is featuring the Royal Wedding live! There will be a funky formal wear contest and a cash champagne bar. Doors open at 6am, wear something silly!

Showtimes for Circus Stella are at 2pm, 4pm and 6pm in Blacksburg First Church of God Parking Lot behind Cabo Fish Taco.

It's a great time for families and college students to get out in the fresh air and enjoy Blacksburg's thriving art culture.
