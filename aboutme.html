<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>My name is Leah Clemens, I am nineteen years old and the youngest of four. My older siblings have all attended NRCC before me and graduated with Associates Degrees. I still have one more year before I receive my Associates as well, and transfer to a four year college. My siblings and I grew up on a farm in Craig County. We had horses, cows, chickens, and several other animals of the Old MacDonald variety. I was home schooled up until 8<sup>th</sup> grade when I was enrolled at Dayspring Christian Academy. I spent two years there before I convinced my parents to let me attend public school. Sophomore year I transferred to Blacksburg High and later graduated with the class of 2016. After graduating, I made the decision to take a gap year before jumping straight into college. That year off helped me decide on pursuing a degree in Information Technology, and in Fall 2017 I enrolled at New River Community College.</p>

<h2>Future Goals</h2>
<p>My biggest goal is more of a dream if I'm being honest. I'd love to get a job that I could do from home that is challenging, yet encourages creativity. I want to have a small studio where I could do all of my work, and create art in my free time. Also, I really want to get a dog when I have my own house.</p>

<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>I have a group of seven friends who I play Dungeons and Dragons with, every other Wednesday night. We get together for some really fun and creative adventures. It's all in the imagination, but the stories and memories that we make together feel very real. I've also gained a bit of an obsession with buying DnD dice that are made with really pretty colors and designs. I've basically become a dragon, hoarding my pile of shiny dice. When I'm not playing an imaginary game with a bunch of awesome nerds, I spend some time with other friends hiking whenever the opportunity arises. Sunrise hikes, sunset hikes, and anytime in between! I don't get out a whole lot, I'm a bit of a hermit, but I do try to mix up my days with a bit of sunshine and fresh air.</p>
