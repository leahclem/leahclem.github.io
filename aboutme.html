<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>
  My name is Leah Clemens, I am twenty-five years old and the youngest of four. 
  My siblings and I grew up on a farm out in Craig County, Virginia. We had horses, cows, chickens, and several other animals of the Old MacDonald variety. 
  I was home schooled up until 8<sup>th</sup> grade, then I attended a private school for two years before transferring to public school to finish high school.
  After graduating, I made the decision to take a gap year in order to work before jumping straight into college. 
  That year off gave me the chance to research what field I wanted to pursue and that's where my interest in Computer Science started.
  I ended up graduating in 2019 with a general studies transfer degree from community college, and later during 2020 I went back to community college 
  and graduated with a transfer Associate's in Computer Science.
  After many life changes I got a part-time Content Development Job at a local tech company while finishing my Bachelor's degree online.
</p>

<h2>Future Goals</h2>
<p>
  There are so many topics within the realm of computer science that I wish to learn more about. 
  My goal is to work as a software engineer, or web developer, while exploring the subject of deep learning in connection to music. 
  I'm fascinated by the digital conversion of sound waves and I hope to someday work within that field.
</p>

<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>I have a group of seven friends who I play Dungeons and Dragons with, every other Wednesday night. We get together for some really fun and creative adventures. It's all in the imagination, but the stories and memories that we make together feel very real. I've also gained a bit of an obsession with buying DnD dice that are made with really pretty colors and designs. I've basically become a dragon, hoarding my pile of shiny dice. When I'm not playing an imaginary game with a bunch of awesome nerds, I spend some time with other friends hiking whenever the opportunity arises. Sunrise hikes, sunset hikes, and anytime in between! I don't get out a whole lot, I'm a bit of a hermit, but I do try to mix up my days with a bit of sunshine and fresh air.</p>
